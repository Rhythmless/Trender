# Twitter-Timeline called Trender
A project for CPS630 at Ryerson University.

This is a web application that was originally completed with the purpose of delivering and storing global trends on Twitter due to Twitter not storing previous trends on their website. It is located at https://twitter-app-timeline.herokuapp.com/ and was developed primarily using the MEAN stack for the functionality of the communication between the MongoDB database and frontend of the application seen by the user. The application ceased collection of information on June 15 due to hosting platform limitations.
